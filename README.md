How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating "user stories" help with this?

Creating a functional and well designs program that will satisfy a user is simply the use of communication. Creating meeting with your clients or users and being able to interpret their wants and translating it into features for your program will allow you to achieve high levels of success. User stories are a good way to get this translation into categorized sections for developers to quickly sort through however they see fit.

How do I approach developing program? What agile processes do I hope to invorporate into my future development work?

Developin a program has a ton of step including learning important skills like programming, quality assurance, communication, etc. I think using agile priniciples will always be a good place to attempt. With short bursts of work getting done and without the need of huge planning to get started. Even with learning the programming aspect just getting started is always best. Agile allows a program to see results early and if any feed back changes plans it won't be a whole project worth of changes.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

A good team member is also one who has the cross functional ability. They are able to do lots of work without absolute need o someone else.
